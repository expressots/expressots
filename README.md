# Expresso TS

A Typescript + [Node.js]("https://nodejs.org/en/") lightweight framework for quick building scalable, easy to read and maintain, server-side applications ðŸš€

## Philosophy

ExpressoTS is a developer-friendly framework designed to streamline the process of building server-side applications. With a focus on readability, maintainability, and scalability, ExpressoTS aims to simplify the development process by providing a clear and concise structure.

Gone are the days of tedious setup tasks such as configuring logging systems, handling authentication, and connecting to databases. With ExpressoTS, developers can focus on what really matters - writing code. The framework takes care of the repetitive and time-consuming aspects of development, allowing developers to work more efficiently.

One of the key features of Expresso TS is its flexible and extensible architecture. The framework provides a simple but powerful dependency injection system that enables developers to quickly and easily extend its functionality by creating and adding providers. This allows developers to seamlessly integrate new features throughout the entire application without having to worry about the complexities of integration.

Whether you're building a simple API or a complex enterprise application, Expresso TS can help you deliver your project on time and on budget. With a comprehensive set of tools and features, Expresso TS makes it easy to build high-quality, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications.
