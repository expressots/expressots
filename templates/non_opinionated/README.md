# Expresso TS

A Typescript + [Node.js]("https://nodejs.org/en/") lightweight framework for quick building scalable, easy to read and maintain, server-side applications ðŸš€

## Philosophy

Expresso TS is a framework designed to make the lives of the developers easier by providing a structure for building server-side applications that is clear to read, maintain and scale. The philosophy is centered around the idea that developers should not have to waste time on repetitive tasks such as setting up a logging system, authentication, error handling, database connection, and organizing the project for better maintainability.

Expresso TS offers a solution that is designed to help developers jump ahead and focus on the most important part of the development process, writing code. The framework provides capability to the developers to quickly extend the framework functionalities by creating providers and adding them to the dependency injection system. This way, developers can use these new functionalities throughout the entire application without having to worry about the complexities of integrating it into the system.
