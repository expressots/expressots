# Expresso TS

A Typescript + [Node.js]("https://nodejs.org/en/") lightweight framework for quick building scalable, easy to read and maintain, server-side applications üöÄ

## Philosophy

ExpressoTS is a TypeScript lightweight framework for building scalable, readable and maintainable server-side applications. The framework provides a level of abstraction on top of common HTTP server framework Expressjs exposing their API's directly to the developer. This provides freedom and brings to the developer a tool that is well known and easy to use.
